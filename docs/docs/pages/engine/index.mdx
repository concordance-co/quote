# Engine Overview

This section documents the core building blocks used by the Concordance Engine to shape model behavior at runtime.

- Mods and the Quote Mod SDK (authoring runtime hooks)
- Shared types (events/actions) and action validation
- Self-prompting and constrained generation strategies
- Flow engine for multi-step, stateful interactions

Explore the subsections to learn how to build, register, and use mods that interact with the engine lifecycle.
